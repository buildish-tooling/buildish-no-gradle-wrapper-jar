# No Gradle Wrapper Jar Release Process

This draft applies the Buildish release architecture to `buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar`.

## Special rule for this component

This component needs an immutable GitHub Release because the release-rendered bootstrap scripts
should point at immutable versioned release assets.

Unlike Mammoth Cache, the final exact tag should stay on the same source commit as the released RC.

## Release branches

Use the Buildish standard release branches:

- `release/1.x`
- `release/1.2.x`

## Draft workflow set

### `Create release branch`

Inputs:

- `release_line`
- `source_ref`

### `Prepare RC`

Inputs:

- exact `version`
- optional `source_sha`

Behavior:

- resolve the source from `source_sha` if provided
- otherwise prefer `release/1.2.x`, then `release/1.x` for version `1.2.3`
- hard-gate the workflow on successful or skipped GitHub checks for the resolved source commit
- derive the next RC number after the highest existing RC for the version, or `0` if none exists
- clean pre-existing RC staging directories for this version from ASF SVN before staging the new RC
- rely on release-branch CI instead of rerunning tests in the draft `Prepare RC` job
- build the reproducible source archive from Git using the shared `buildish-release-tooling`
  component
- sign the source archive with `gpg` using `BUILDISH_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`
- stage the source archive, `.sha512`, and `.asc` into ASF SVN using
  `BUILDISH_SVN_DEV_USERNAME` / `BUILDISH_SVN_DEV_PASSWORD`
- create or re-create the draft GitHub Release for the final exact version
- emit GitHub Summary blocks for:
  - vote email templates
  - source artifact SHA512
  - source artifact detached ASCII-armored signature
  - RC verification commands

### `Verify RC`

This is authored as a bash script for trusted local Linux/macOS execution and may also be used from
a manual workflow.

### `Release version`

Inputs:

- exact `version`

Behavior:

- resolve the latest RC for the version
- promote the exact source release from Apache `dist/dev` to `dist/release`
- prune older releases from the same release line out of Apache `dist/release`
- create the final exact tag on the exact same source commit as the RC
- finalize the draft GitHub Release
- upload the immutable bootstrap-helper asset set
- emit GitHub Summary blocks for:
  - source artifact SHA512
  - source artifact detached ASCII-armored signature
  - archived same-line releases
  - final GitHub Release asset URLs

This draft keeps moving aliases disabled for this component.

## Files in this draft

- `buildish-release-tooling/release-config.yaml`: component policy consumed by
  `buildish-release-tooling`
- `buildish-release-tooling/release-tooling.sh`: a thin bash dispatcher that locates the component
  policy and runs `uv run --project <resolved-tooling-checkout> --frozen buildish-release-tooling
  <command> ...`
- `workflows/`: draft workflow YAML showing job boundaries and retries; the jobs install `uv`,
  fetch full Git state, and invoke the component wrappers
- `../buildish-release-tooling/tests/`: shared Python unit and integration tests that load this
  component's real `buildish-release-tooling/release-config.yaml` and smoke-test
  `buildish-release-tooling/release-tooling.sh`
