# Buildish no-gradle-wrapper-jar blueprint

This directory contains a copyable blueprint for projects that want local `gradlew` / `gradlew.bat`
usage without checking `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` into the source tree.

Projects copy these files into their own `gradle/` directory as:

- `gradle/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.sh`
- `gradle/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.ps1`
- `gradle/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.init.gradle.kts`

Then they add one small invocation to their generated `gradlew` / `gradlew.bat`, following the
same include-style approach used by `gradle-wrapper-no-jar`.

## Files in this blueprint

- `buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.sh` — POSIX helper for `gradlew`
- `buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.ps1` — PowerShell helper for Windows / `gradlew.bat`
- `buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.init.gradle.kts` — Gradle init script that re-patches freshly generated launcher files after `:wrapper`

The helpers are standalone on purpose. They do not import this repository's TypeScript runtime.

## Automatic installation scripts

This repository also ships installer entrypoints that download the helper files plus the init
script, patch existing `gradlew` / `gradlew.bat`, remove any pre-existing
`gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`, and add the retained wrapper metadata patterns to
`.gitignore`.

### POSIX / bash

Run from the target project root:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/buildish/main/tools/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar/install.sh | bash
```

To target a different directory:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/buildish/main/tools/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar/install.sh | bash -s -- /path/to/project
```

### Windows / PowerShell

Run from the target project root:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/buildish/main/tools/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar/install.ps1 | Invoke-Expression
```

Or run it against a specific directory after downloading/cloning this repository locally:

```powershell
powershell -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar\install.ps1 C:\path\to\project
```

### Security note

The `curl | bash` and `Invoke-RestMethod | Invoke-Expression` forms execute remote script content.
Prefer pinning to a reviewed tag or commit, or download the installer first and inspect it before
execution if your environment requires stricter supply-chain controls.

For trusted local development and integration testing, set
`BUILDISH_NO_GRADLE_WRAPPER_JAR_SOURCE_DIR` to a checked-out
`tools/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar/` directory to copy helper files from disk instead of
downloading them from GitHub.

## What the helpers do

The helpers read `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`, derive the configured Gradle version,
ensure that `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` is present and verified before Gradle starts, and
inject the project-local Gradle init script when it is available.

They mirror the _Apache Buildish Mammoth Cache for Gradle_ action's trust model:

1. require a canonical `https://services.gradle.org/distributions/...` `distributionUrl`
2. download the wrapper JAR checksum from `services.gradle.org`
3. download the wrapper JAR detached signature from `services.gradle.org`
4. download the wrapper JAR bytes from the matching Gradle source tag on GitHub
5. verify the JAR against both:
   - the authoritative SHA-256 checksum
   - the detached OpenPGP signature using pinned Gradle signing keys

The helpers retain the downloaded metadata beside the wrapper properties file as:

- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper-<version>.sha256`
- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper-<version>.asc`

They write downloaded files through temporary paths and then move them into place, so partially
written files are not left behind if a download or verification step fails.

The injected init script hooks the Gradle `Wrapper` task so that when Renovate or a developer runs
`./gradlew wrapper`, the freshly generated `gradlew` / `gradlew.bat` files are patched again with
the Buildish helper invocation.

## Required tools

### POSIX helper

- POSIX shell
- `curl`
- `gpg`
- `mktemp`
- either `sha256sum` or `shasum`

### PowerShell helper

- Windows PowerShell / PowerShell
- `gpg` / `gpg.exe`
- `Invoke-WebRequest`
- `Get-FileHash`

## How projects adopt the helper

### 1. Copy the helper files into the target project

If you use the automatic installer above, it performs this copy step and the launcher/
`.gitignore` updates for you.

Copy:

- `tools/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.sh` -> `gradle/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.sh`
- `tools/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.ps1` -> `gradle/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.ps1`
- `tools/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.init.gradle.kts` -> `gradle/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.init.gradle.kts`

### 2. Patch `gradlew`

Insert the following line immediately after `APP_HOME` is resolved:

```sh
. "${APP_HOME}/gradle/buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.sh"
```

In current Gradle launchers, that means directly after:

```sh
APP_HOME=$( cd -P "${APP_HOME:-./}" > /dev/null && printf '%s\n' "$PWD" ) || exit
```

### 3. Patch `gradlew.bat`

Insert the following block immediately after the `for %%i in ("%APP_HOME%") do set APP_HOME=%%~fi`
line, and replace the final `"%JAVA_EXE%" ... %*` invocation so it includes
`%BUILDISH_NO_GRADLE_WRAPPER_JAR_ARGS%` before `%*`:

```bat
set BUILDISH_NO_GRADLE_WRAPPER_JAR_ORIGINAL_ARGS=%*
set BUILDISH_NO_GRADLE_WRAPPER_JAR_ARGS=
for /f "delims=" %%a in ('powershell -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "%APP_HOME%\gradle\buildish-no-gradle-wrapper-jar.ps1"') do @set BUILDISH_NO_GRADLE_WRAPPER_JAR_ARGS=%%a
set BUILDISH_NO_GRADLE_WRAPPER_JAR_ORIGINAL_ARGS=
if errorlevel 1 goto fail
```

### 4. Stop tracking `gradle-wrapper.jar`

Projects that want source trees without compiled wrapper binaries should remove
`gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` from version control.

Whether projects also commit the retained `.sha256` / `.asc` files is a policy choice. The helper
works when those files are absent because it will download and retain them locally.

## Development and verification

This tool directory has its own local verification trampoline:

- `make test` — shell integration tests using `gradle init`
- `make rat-check` — Apache RAT over the tracked tool files
- `make check` — syntax checks, integration tests, and RAT

The integration tests expect these commands to be available on `PATH`:

- `gradle`
- `pwsh`
- `gpg`

They also need network access so the helper can fetch the wrapper JAR, checksum, and detached
signature from the upstream Gradle endpoints.

## Customization boundaries

The scripts intentionally assume the same Gradle hosts as the action:

- `services.gradle.org` for checksum and detached signature metadata
- `raw.githubusercontent.com/gradle/gradle/...` for the wrapper JAR bytes

Projects that use custom Gradle distributions or custom wrapper JAR locations will need to adapt
the URLs and, possibly, the trust material.

## Current validation scope in this repository

This repository validates the blueprint with tool-local syntax checks, shell integration tests that
exercise `gradle init` plus `./gradlew ...` flows, and a dedicated Apache RAT check for the tracked
tool files.

The repository has also run a realistic wrapper-upgrade probe that bootstraps with Gradle `8.1.1`
and Java `17`, then upgrades through the latest tested patch release of each minor line from `8.1`
through `9.4`:

- `8.1.1`, `8.2.1`, `8.3`, `8.4`, `8.5`, `8.6`, `8.7`, `8.8`, `8.9`
- `8.10.2`, `8.11.1`, `8.12.1`, `8.13`, `8.14.4`
- `9.0.0`, `9.1.0`, `9.2.1`, `9.3.1`, `9.4.1`

That version exercise is a record of test coverage in this repository, not a compatibility promise
or formal support guarantee for every project layout, operating system, shell environment, or future
Gradle release.
